# Then run `claude` and copy & paste this prompt.

Build a very simple react app to convert a human description of a time interval into a start and end timestamp.

The app should have just a single input in the middle of the screen with the label "Describe time interval",
when the users submits the input, we need a loading state while the backend converts the input to a start and end timestamp.

When the backend returns, show the start and end timestamps in a card together with a human summary.

The backend may return an error, in which case show the error message in a card.

The app should be clean and modern with no drop shadows or gradients, the background color should be a light cream color, and the main content, should have white backgrounds. The text should be the "IMB Plex Sans" font from google fonts.
